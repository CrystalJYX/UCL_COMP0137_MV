    "In this section, we'll work on building two components that we need for 2B, a method to estimate that transformation and a method that can project points into camera image space.\n",

    "First we'll tackle the projection method, `projectiveCamera`. We want to find the image space coordinates, `XImCart`, of a set of 3D world coordinates, `XCart`, given a camera intrinsics matrix `K` and an extrinsics matrix `T`.\n",

    "The second component is a method to estimate a Eucledian transformation, `TEst`, that takes us from a plane's 3D coordinate space to 3D camera space by utilizing a given set of points in camera image space, `XImCart`, and a set of corresponding points in world space, `XCart`. Essentially we want to compute the extrinsics matrix we can use in `projectiveCamera`.\n",
